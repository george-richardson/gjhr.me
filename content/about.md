## Hobbies

* Painting miniature men for the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000.
* Playing Dungeons and Dragons once a week, currently with a wood elf monk who punches a whole lot of things... and runs up walls.
* Occasionally I will play squash although I am not any good at it.
* Film. I love movies and going to the cinema.
