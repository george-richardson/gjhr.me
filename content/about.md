## Career

I am a "devops" engineer, although I would argue the role should not exist. I currently work at The Scale Factory.

## Education

I have a first class bachelors degree in computer science from Queen Mary, University of London. For my final year project I made a platform for executing map reduce jobs written in Haskell across multiple computers.

I have also attained the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Professional (SAP), AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional (DOP), AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA), AWS Certified Security - Specialty (SCS) and Azure Developer Associate certifications.

## Hobbies

* Painting miniature men for the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000.
* Playing Dungeons and Dragons once a week, currently with a wood elf monk who punches a whole lot of things... and runs up walls.
* Occasionally I will play squash although I am not any good at it.
* Film. I love movies and going to the cinema.
