title: "It took literally two minutes to deploy plausible"

Last night I saw [a post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29121589) on 
Hacker News about [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/), a lightweight GDPR 
compliant alternative to Google Analytics. As you may be able to tell from the 
formatting of my website, that feature set really speaks to me. I decided to 
give it a go and was amazed at how quickly and easily I could get going. 

At approximately 23:25 I filled out the registration form. At 23:26 I received
the confirmation email. By 23:27 I had added the snippet to my head.html 
template, pushed it to GitHub and my workflow had deployed the update. The whole
process could not have been easier.

The longest part of the whole process was probably the 10 seconds it took me 
to remember I had uBlock Origin installed which was blocking my views from being 
registered.

Time will tell if I use it past the free trial period. So far I am impressed by 
the elegance of the product. But, I'm not sure I need to pay money for someone 
to tell me [nobody reads this blog](https://plausible.io/gjhr.me).
