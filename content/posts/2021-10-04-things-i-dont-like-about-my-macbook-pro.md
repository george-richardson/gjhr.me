I have recently started a new job and for the first time in my life I now have a
MacBook. So far I cannot say that I am particularly whelmed by the machine. 

* The Thunderbolt implementation is crap.
  * MacOS frequently crashes after plugging into my dock which I've never had issues 
    with before.
  * I had to use a strange workaround to get multi-monitor support over a single
    port because macOS doesn't implement DisplayPort MST.
  * Sometimes one monitor still isn't recognised properly which means I have to 
    re-plug which increases the chances of a crash.
  * Never allows me to login after cold boot using an external monitor. 
* Other peripherals break. (These could also be due to the Thunderbolt being 
  crap though).
  * 50% of the time I cannot wake my computer with my mouse, meaning I have to 
    open the lid just to wake it up and then close it again. 
  * My keyboard will sometimes become super laggy which I can fix by unplugging 
    it and then plugging it back in. 
  * My Canon camera often isn't recognised over USB. This makes the beginning of
    Zoom calls very fraught. (Could be a Canon issue but my other experiences 
    don't make me feel generous about giving Apple the benefit of the doubt.)
* The desktop experience is archaic. 
  * No native ability to snap windows to sides of screens.
  * Native task switching behaviour (cmd+tab) switches apps and not windows. 
  * Window previews through the dock require a "Force Click" which I cannot do 
    with my ergonomic mouse.
  * I have to mount a disk to install software? And then I have to unmount it
    myself when I am done?
  * Home and End keys are usually (but not always) pointless. 
  * I can't tell if I am using ethernet except by going into system preferences.

That's not to say it is all bad. I like the touchpad. I like having a Unix based
OS for the kind of work I do. I like how the pointer gets big when I wiggle it. 
Of course some of my complaints are also a little subjective. However, that 
doesn't mean the switch hasn't been an incredibly frustrating experience. 

I'm not sure the complaints list for my last Windows laptop would be much 
smaller though...
