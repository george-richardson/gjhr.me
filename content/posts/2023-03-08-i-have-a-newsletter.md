You can now sign up to receive my musings straight to your inbox, just use the form at the bottom of this page!

For fun, I also wrote my own serverless app to send the emails. Here are some things it can do:

* Serve a [subscribe/unsubscribe page](https://newsletter.gjhr.me).
* Subscribe to RSS feeds and send new posts to subscribers. 
* Serve multiple newsletters from one install (with multiple domains!).
* Handle bounces and complaints automatically.
* Inject unsubscribe link into emails before sending. 
* Cost pennies to run. 

Here are some things it doesn't yet do: 

* Have any kind of usable interface for configuration.
* Have any documentation whatsoever. 
* Good error handling.

If you are interested, you can take a look at [the code](https://github.com/george-richardson/newsletter) and try and puzzle it out yourself.

And don't forget to subscribe!
